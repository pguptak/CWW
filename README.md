<h1>Python Software Libraries for Computing with Words (CWW) Methodologies </h1>
<h3>Computing with Words (CWW) was proposed by Prof. Zadeh in 1996 [1], which allows a human being to interact with a computing machine using the linguistic information as well as obtain recommendations from it in the linguistic form. CWW has attracted many theorectical as well as application based contributions. To realise the power of CWW viz., from concepts to application, CWW methodologies are a very powerful tool.</h3>
<h3>Various CWW methodologies have been proposed in the literarture, however, most of the software for these methodologies uses platforms like MATLAB. </h3>

on platforms like MATLAB, etc. As, Python has recently emerged as a versatile programming language with its application in various domains, hence, we have also developed the Python based implementations for numerous CWW methodologies. Through this work, we present their details for the interested users, draw a comparisons and improvements as well as provide links to access the Python-based software of the popular CWW methodologies.
