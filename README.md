<h1>Python Software Libraries for Computing with Words (CWW) Methodologies </h1>
Computing with Words (CWW) was proposed by Prof. Zadeh in 1996 allows a human being to interact is a remarkable approach that enables human beings to interact with computing machines using linguistic information. Recently, there have been various contributions in the realm of CWW methodologies (both theorectical and application oriented). However, very less work exists on the provision of software libraries of these methodologies to the interested users/ researchers. To the best of our knowledge, most of the software code available for these CWW methodologies is on platforms like MATLAB, etc. As, Python has recently emerged as a versatile programming language with its application in various domains, hence, we have also developed the Python based implementations for numerous CWW methodologies. Through this work, we present their details for the interested users, draw a comparisons and improvements as well as provide links to access the Python-based software of the popular CWW methodologies.
