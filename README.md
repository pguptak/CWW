<h1>Python Software Libraries for Computing with Words (CWW) Methodologies </h1>
<h3>Computing with Words (CWW) was proposed by Prof. Zadeh in 1996 [1], which allows a human being to interact with a computing machine using the linguistic information as well as obtain recommendations from it in the linguistic form. CWW has attracted many theorectical as well as application based contributions. To realise the power of CWW viz., from concepts to application, CWW methodologies are a very powerful tool.</h3>
<h3>Various CWW methodologies have been proposed in the literarture [2]. In our present work entitled "Python Software Libraries for Computing with Words (CWW) Methodologies" [currently under review], we have developed and provided the Python libraries of nine CWW methodologies viz., Augmented Extension Principle Based CWW Methodology (AEPCM), Extension Principle Based CWW Methodology (EPCM), Intutionistic Fuzzy Sets Based CWW Methodology (IFSCM), Symbolic Method Based CWW Methodology (SMCM), Rough Sets Based CWW Methodology (RSCM), 2-tuple Based CWW Methodology (2TPCM), Perceptual Computing based on Interval Approach (IA), </h3>

on platforms like MATLAB, etc. As, Python has recently emerged as a versatile programming language with its application in various domains, hence, we have also developed the Python based implementations for numerous CWW methodologies. Through this work, we present their details for the interested users, draw a comparisons and improvements as well as provide links to access the Python-based software of the popular CWW methodologies.
